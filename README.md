# For Developers:
Due to security reasons, the API key for AccuWeather is not included in the source code. You must create a `config.ini` file at the root level in the following format:

```ini
[accuweather_api_keys]
key=NEhQ6xAMK0AgC9vWwpCaDMgWznYoPS83
```

You can get a free AccuWeather APi Key here: https://developer.accuweather.com/packages
