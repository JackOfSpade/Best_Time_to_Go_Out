# For Developers
Due to security reasons, the API key for Amazon Polly used in the compiled `TextToSpeech.jar` is not included in the source code. You must change the following line in `AmazonPolly.java` before compiling:

```java 
BasicAWSCredentials credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("Your_Access_Key_ID", "Your_Secret_Key");
```

You can get a free AccuWeather API Key here: https://developer.accuweather.com/packages
